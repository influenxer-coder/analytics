The video guides you through product setup. The video compares multiple products. The video shows the product being unpacked. How do I store this product? We recommend you store it in a well-closed container away from moisture, direct sunlight, and heat. It's a common occurrence for softgels to stick together, but a firm shake of the pouch or a gentle tap against a surface should easily separate them. What is the source of the gelatin in the softgels? The gelatin used in our softgels is sourced from natural bovine, ensuring a high-quality and consistent encapsulation process with every batch. Why do the softgels have a cloudy appearance? Due to the addition of natural coconut oil, it will soften under hot temperatures, which may cause a milky, spotted appearing softgel. Is it normal for there to be a fishy smell when I open the package? The softgels themselves are odorless, however, the sealed pouch can trap scents inside. You may notice a light odor when you first open it, but this has no effect on the product's usability or nutritional value.

Iupilon 5.0 out of 5 stars Micro Ingredients Vitamin D3 5000 IU with K2: A Radiant Review Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2025 Style: 5,000IU Coconut Oil Softgels Size: 300 Count (Pack of 1) Verified Purchase This vitamin D3 and K2 supplement duo has been a game-changer for my health and wellness routine! As someone who's always looking for ways to boost my overall health, I decided to give Micro Ingredients Vitamin D3 5000 IU with K2 a try, and I'm so glad I did. Pros: + Tiny but mighty: The soft gels are incredibly small and easy to swallow, making them perfect for those who struggle with larger pills. + Effective dosage: Despite their small size, these soft gels deliver a potent dose of vitamin D, which has noticeably improved my energy levels and mood. + Enhanced absorption: The addition of vitamin K2 not only supports bone health but also helps the body properly absorb vitamin D, ensuring maximum effectiveness. + No bad taste: Unlike some other vitamin supplements, these soft gels have no unpleasant aftertaste. + Affordable price: The price is very reasonable, making it a cost-effective way to invest in my health. + Improved energy and mood: I've experienced a significant boost in my energy levels and overall mood since I started taking these supplements. + Better sleep: Surprisingly, I've also noticed an improvement in my sleep quality, which is an added bonus! + Reduced inflammation: Some reviewers have even reported a reduction in inflammation, which is promising for those with inflammatory conditions. Cons: - Potential for side effects: While I haven't personally experienced any side effects, some reviewers have reported headaches, stomach issues, or other adverse reactions. It's important to consult your doctor before starting any new supplement, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking other medications. - Packaging concerns: The resealable bag, while environmentally friendly, can be a bit tricky to open and close. Some reviewers have also reported issues with the bag not sealing properly or tearing. Overall Impression: I'm thoroughly impressed with Micro Ingredients Vitamin D3 5000 IU with K2. This supplement duo has become an essential part of my daily routine, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a high-quality, effective, and affordable way to support their overall health and well-being.

I LOVE this about this product. So many vitamin supplements are big and hard to swallow. The other thing I noticed about this supplement is that is SMELLS like coconut. There is no residual taste or burps after you take them. I have only taken them for a couple of days, but I already notice less inflammation in my hips. We will see after a month, but so far I have high  hopes. So many other supplements have unnecessary things in them that just take up space and may or may not be good for you. The ingredients list lists four things, D3, K2, coconut oil and the soft gel. If the inflammation in my hips keeps going down I will definitely be buying more of this product.

I've noticed a remarkable change in a lot of my health metrics, especially mental health and blood pressure. I'm not attributing these changes to only adding Vitamin D to my diet, because I'm not a doctor, but I feel they are part of a healthy regimen.  Highly recommend, I'm on my 3rd bag.

I have to go down to taking them  not everyday but only  twice a week, because I have Medullary sponge kidney disease& too much vitamin D can cause problems like kidney stones  but for those that do not have a disease like this & are lacking vitamin D these definitely work very good!!

Some reviews said they had their pills stuck together, but  I've got 4 bags so far  & never had problems !!
